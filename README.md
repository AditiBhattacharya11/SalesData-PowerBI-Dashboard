# SalesData-PowerBI-Dashboard
This sales data analysis project entails analyzing a company's sales data and indicating profit by product, sales, and other significant factors that might influence the company's performance.
The data set must be connected to Power BI Desktop to remove irrelevant data before visualizing and exporting the filtered data as dashboards. The dashboard could leverage Power BI visualization types such as Pie Charts, Bar Charts, Doughnut Charts, Funnel Charts, etc.
The Data has been sorted/filtered under three categories mainly the country/region, the mode of shipment(first class, second class, same dday) and category of product(furniture, technology,office supplies).
Various charts and graphs can be accessed and analysed using these filters which in turn will give the required information.
